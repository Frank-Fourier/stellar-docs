title: Tokens Overview
description: Choose between the Stellar Asset Contract and Custom Tokens
---

Tokens exist in two forms on Stellar: 1) assets issued by Stellar accounts (Stellar assets can have a [Stellar Asset Contract (SAC)](./stellar-asset-contract.mdx) implementation), and 2) as a [custom token](./token-interface.mdx) created by a smart contract.

Several factors (such as project-specific requirements and network capabilities) can help you determine whether to issue an asset on Stellar or create a custom token with a smart contract for your project.

However:

### TL;DR

If possible, we recommend issuing a Stellar asset and (if needed) using the SAC to interact with that asset in smart contracts. More on why below.

## Issuing assets on Stellar

Stellar is first-class in asset tokenization — issuing an asset can be done in [just one single transaction](https://developers.stellar.org/docs).

Stellar’s transactions are fast and cost-effective, making the network great for remittances and micropayments. It also has built-in features for compliance, asset management, and auditing. If you are just looking to perform simple transfers, issuing assets on Stellar has all the needed capabilities.

Stellar assets:

Are already widely supported in the Stellar ecosystem and other ecosystems (such as Stellar USDC on Coinbase). Benefit from [anchors](../../learn/encyclopedia/anchors.mdx), the bridges between the Stellar network and traditional financial systems. Explore the global [Stellar anchor directory](https://anchors.stellar.org/) for further details. Give the issuer granular control over asset management with features that allow the issuer to [publish asset information](../../issuing-assets/publishing-asset-info.mdx), [ensure compliance](../../issuing-assets/anatomy-of-an-asset.mdx#compliance), and [regulate asset supply](../../issuing-assets/control-asset-access.mdx#limiting-the-supply-of-an-asset).

Assets issued on the Stellar network are accessible to smart contracts with the use of that asset’s Stellar Asset Contract (SAC).

### Stellar Asset Contract

The Stellar Asset Contract (SAC) is compiled into the protocol layer and allows smart contracts to interact with assets issued on Stellar. Every Stellar asset has reserved a SAC on the network that can be deployed by anyone who wants to interact with the asset from a contract. The SAC has access to all account (for XLM) and trustline (for all other assets) balances as well as smart contract token balances.

Read more about the SAC [here](./stellar-asset-contract.mdx).

Learn how to deploy a Stellar Asset Contract for an asset in [this How-To Guide](../../smart-contracts/guides/cli/deploy-stellar-asset-contract.mdx).

**Benefits of the SAC:**

- Compatibility: Stellar ecosystem products (such as Stellar wallets) and other ecosystem products (such as exchanges) already know how to interact with Stellar assets, making the SAC more interoperable.
- Cost and resource efficiency: the SAC is built into the protocol-level code that already runs the network. So, there is no need to spin up a Wasm contract’s VM to invoke a function. Each function within the SAC will be more resource-efficient than its custom-coded counterpart.
- Less work: you don’t have to write an entirely new contract. A Stellar asset’s SAC already exists on the network and just needs to be deployed to be used.

**Downside of the SAC:**

- You cannot customize the SAC (with one exception, explained below). If you’re looking to use assets in a way not supported by the SAC, you can create your own custom smart contract token using the token interface. **Exception:** the asset issuer is automatically the admin for that asset’s SAC. However, the SAC allows the asset issuer to set a different admin address. Making this admin another smart contract means that you can add a bit of customization and logic to how the asset will authorize balances and trustlines, mint tokens, etc.

## Custom tokens

If you have a unique use case where the SAC's predefined capabilities do not work for you, you can create a custom token using the [token interface](./token-interface.mdx). The token interface is a software interface that specifies what it means to be a smart contract token. The user can implement their own token contract that uses all the functions of this interface, and all tokens that implement this interface are interoperable with each other. The token interface executes on the smart contract layer instead of the protocol layer.

:::note

Tokens created with smart contracts cannot interact with Stellar assets unless that Stellar asset has a deployed SAC.

:::

**These example scenarios are not possible with the SAC and demonstrate what you could use the token interface for:**

- As the creator of a new token, you decide to implement a feature within your custom token smart contract that enables you to receive a 1% fee from every transaction involving your token. Whenever someone transfers your token to another user, 1% of the transferred amount is automatically deducted and sent to a designated wallet address that you control.
- You want to develop a factory contract that automates the creation of instances of a specific token. This contract serves as a centralized and standardized way to deploy new token contracts on demand without manual intervention each time a new instance is needed.
