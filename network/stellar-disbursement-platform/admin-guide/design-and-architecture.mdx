The Stellar Disbursement Platform consists of four services deployed together:

- **Dashboard**: the user interface administrators use to initiate and track the progress of disbursements
- **SDP Core Service**: the core backend service that performs several functions:
  - **Admin API**: the API used by the host organization to manage tenant provisioning and configuration. The API is documented [here](../resources/admin/README.mdx)
  - **Dashboard API**: the API used by the front-end UI for all disbursement requests. The API is documented [here](../resources/README.mdx)
  - **Messaging Service**: a recurring process that sends text messages to users prompting them to download the wallet selected for a particular disbursement and verify their phone with an OTP
  - **Wallet Registration UI**: a web application that collects and verifies the recipient’s OTP code and verification information via Stellar’s [SEP-24: Hosted Deposit and Withdrawal](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md) protocol
- **Anchor Platform Service**: the API server that the wallet uses to authenticate and initiate the recipient’s registration process through the SEP-24 deposit flow
- **Transaction Submission Service**: the service that submits all payment transactions to the Stellar network. This service is designed to maximize payment throughput, handle queuing, and graceful resubmission/error handling

## Dependencies {#dependencies}

- **Container Orchestration**: the SDP is packaged as Docker containers and can be deployed to Kubernetes or AWS Fargate. SDF provides a Helm Chart for Kubernetes
- **Postgres**: the SDP uses a Postgres database server for all of its services
- **Apache Kafka**: the SDP optionally uses Kafka for streaming events between services. This is primarily used between SDP Core Service and Transaction Submission Service
- **Twilio or AWS SNS and SES**: the SDP’s messaging service uses SMS messages via Twilio or AWS SNS and administrative emails for organization account setup and recovery via AWS SES
- **Stellar Accounts**:
  - Distribution Account: the SDP requires access to at least one funded Stellar account to make payments to the recipient
  - SEP-10 Auth Account: the SDP requires a Stellar account for the mutual authentication protocol [SEP-10: Stellar Web Authentication](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0010.md) used to connect to wallet applications

## Database & Schemas {#database}

The SDP uses a Postgres database for all of its services. The database schema is managed by the SDP Core Service and is versioned in the codebase.
The database schema is designed to be tenant-aware, meaning that each tenant has its own set of tables and data. This allows the SDP to be multi-tenant and support multiple organizations using the same instance.

There are 3 types of schemas in the database:

- **Admin Schema**: contains tables for managing tenants. This schema is used by the Admin API to manage tenant configuration and provisioning.
- **TSS Schema**: contains tables for managing transactions. This schema is used by the Transaction Submission Service to manage the state of payment transactions.
- **Tenant Schemas**: each tenant has its own schema that contains tables for managing disbursements, recipients, and other tenant-specific data. These schemas are prefixed with `sdp_`.
